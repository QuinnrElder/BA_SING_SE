 ## Functionality
A React-app built with JavaScript, that utilizes fetching API dataSets to allow a customer or manager to check into their own booking page of the BA-SING-SE APP. Once logged in the customer or manager should see the appropriate page and data needed to navigate the site, search by date and names. make hotel a booking.

 ### Technologies Used
* React
* React Router
* React Testing Library
* Asynchronous Testing
* Multiple Fetch Calls
## Learning Goals
## Solidify and demonstrate understanding of the following:
* Using React framework to build complex application
* Implementing React Router
* Unit testing for each component
* Integration Testing spanning multiple components
* Multiple fetch calls
* Asynchronous testing and mocking fetch calls
* Data Restructuring
## Challenges
* Multiple components needed to adhere to the single responsibility principle. While others we soly rendered on conditions.
* Asynchronous testing with multiple fetch calls on different components. It took awhile to understand the intricacies of the React Testing Library and I feel much stronger about testing!
* Conditional redering Components based off of a State prop was new and a helper with similiar components
* Extensions not completed:
  - Having a manger be able to book a room for a customer.
  - Having a manger be able to delete a booking of a room for a customer
## Wins
This was a fun project with many different components and topics that all came together! I am most happy with my testing library and never giving up when things didnt work out the first try or 20th! My primary goal of the project was to gain a deeper understanding of the React Testing Library while trying to take a new approach to an old idea.
